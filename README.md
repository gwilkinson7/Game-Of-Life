# GameOfLife
Small demo functionality for a cellular automata program modelling Conway's Game Of Life.

# Welcome!
Thank you for taking a look at my small little project here. The goal was to create all of the functionality to render Conway's Game of Life, but I got carried away
and ended up adding a few extra options to play around with. Feel free to fork if there's any other functionality you'd like to add!
